    summary: "A simple, consistent AM/PM routine for healthy, glowing skin.",
    content: `Healthy skin starts with consistency. Begin your day by cleansing your face with a mild, pH-balanced cleanser to remove dirt and excess oil. Follow it with a lightweight moisturizer to lock in hydration. Sunscreen is a must‚Äîeven indoors‚Äîto protect from UV damage.

In the evening, cleanse again to remove pollutants and makeup, apply a nourishing night cream or serum, and let your skin heal overnight. Remember, hydration, a balanced diet, and proper sleep are just as important as external care.

Tip: Avoid over-exfoliating (1‚Äì2 times/week is enough). Introduce active ingredients slowly (like retinol or AHAs), and always patch-test new products to prevent reactions.`

    content: `Knowing your skin type helps you choose the right products.

Oily Skin: Shiny, with large pores and prone to acne.

Dry Skin: Feels tight, flaky, or rough.

Combination Skin: Oily in the T-zone (forehead, nose, chin) but dry on cheeks.

Sensitive Skin: Easily irritated, red, or itchy.

To test, wash your face, leave it bare for an hour, and notice the changes. Right diagnosis means healthier care.

Pro tip: Your skin type can change with weather, hormones, or medications. Reassess every few months and adjust your routine.`

Regular cleansing, dermatologist-prescribed medication, and a healthy lifestyle can control breakouts. Remember, acne is treatable‚Äîdon‚Äôt believe the myths!

Important: Avoid using many actives at once (like benzoyl peroxide + retinoid for beginners). Start slow, moisturize adequately, and use sunscreen daily.`

Professional treatments such as chemical peels, botox, and laser therapies also improve skin texture. Most importantly, sleep well, eat antioxidant-rich foods, and avoid smoking. Healthy living reflects on your skin.

Lifestyle add-on: Manage stress (yoga/meditation), limit alcohol, and include collagen-supporting nutrients (protein, vitamin C, zinc) in your diet.`

Daily use of SPF 30+ prevents tanning, pigmentation, premature wrinkles, and even skin cancer. Apply generously on face, neck, and exposed areas 20 minutes before stepping out, and reapply every 3‚Äì4 hours.

Choose broad-spectrum SPF with PA+++ or higher. Use 2-fingers rule for the face, and don‚Äôt forget ears, neck, and hands.`

To reduce hair fall, eat protein-rich foods, massage your scalp, avoid excessive heat styling, and manage stress. If shedding continues, consult a dermatologist to rule out conditions like thyroid issues or alopecia.

If dandruff persists with itching or redness, visit a dermatologist‚Äîit could be seborrheic dermatitis.
