    summary: "Daily routine, sunscreen, hydration, diet, gentle cleansing.",
    content: `Maintaining healthy skin doesn't require expensive products or complicated routines. Here are five simple daily habits that can transform your skin health:

**1. Gentle Cleansing**
Use a mild, pH-balanced cleanser twice daily. Avoid harsh scrubbing which can damage your skin barrier.

**2. Never Skip Sunscreen**
Apply broad-spectrum SPF 30+ every day, even indoors. UV rays are the leading cause of premature aging.

**3. Stay Hydrated**
Drink at least 8 glasses of water daily. Hydrated skin looks plumper and more radiant.

**4. Eat Antioxidant-Rich Foods**
Include berries, leafy greens, and omega-3 rich foods in your diet for skin nourishment from within.

**5. Get Quality Sleep**
Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep. Your skin repairs itself while you sleep.

Remember, consistency is key. Small daily efforts lead to significant long-term results.`

    author: "Dr. M Bhargavi",
    date: "March 10, 2024",
    summary: "Causes, proven treatments, myths, when to see a specialist.",
    content: `Acne affects millions of people worldwide, yet many myths persist about its treatment. Let's separate fact from fiction:

**What Actually Causes Acne:**
- Excess oil production
- Clogged hair follicles
- Bacteria (particularly P. acnes)
- Hormonal fluctuations

**Proven Treatments:**
- Topical retinoids
- Salicylic acid
- Benzoyl peroxide
- Professional chemical peels
- Prescription medications when needed

**Common Myths Debunked:**
- Myth: Oily foods cause acne (False - diet has limited direct impact)
- Myth: You can "dry out" acne (False - over-drying worsens the condition)
- Myth: Sun exposure helps acne (False - it may temporarily hide redness but worsens long-term)

**When to See a Dermatologist:**
If over-the-counter treatments haven't worked after 6-8 weeks, or if you have painful, deep cysts, professional treatment can prevent scarring and achieve better results.`

    author: "Dr. M Bhargavi",
    date: "March 5, 2024",
    summary: "SPF basics, reapplication, photoaging, broad-spectrum protection.",
    content: `Sun protection is crucial for preventing skin cancer and premature aging. Here's what you need to know:

**SPF Basics:**
- SPF 30 blocks 97% of UVB rays
- SPF 50 blocks 98% of UVB rays
- Higher SPF doesn't mean you can skip reapplication

**The Reapplication Rule:**
Apply sunscreen 30 minutes before sun exposure and reapply every 2 hours, or immediately after swimming or sweating.

**Broad-Spectrum is Essential:**
Look for sunscreens that protect against both UVA and UVB rays. UVA rays cause aging, while UVB rays cause burning.

**Common Myths:**
- Myth: You don't need sunscreen on cloudy days (False - 80% of UV rays penetrate clouds)
- Myth: Darker skin doesn't need sunscreen (False - all skin types can develop skin cancer)
- Myth: Makeup with SPF is enough (Partially false - it's good additional protection but shouldn't be your only defense)

**Additional Protection:**
- Seek shade during peak hours (10 AM - 4 PM)
- Wear protective clothing and wide-brimmed hats
- Use sunglasses to protect the delicate eye area

Remember: Sun damage is cumulative and irreversible, so start protecting your skin today!`
